## 👩‍🏫 Instructor

## 🎓 About the Bootcamp

This SQL Bootcamp was a **10-day online training session** where I have  covered everything from SQL basics to advanced concepts. Participants learned SQL through interactive exercises, real-world sample data, and practical queries. The training was structured to provide both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice to ensure a deep understanding of the language.
